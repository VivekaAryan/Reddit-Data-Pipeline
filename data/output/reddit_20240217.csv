1at7mdg,Update to interview posts,"After careful consideration and listening to your feedback, we've decided to no longer allow interview-related posts because they take away focus from our community's main purpose.

In the past, although they usually weren't directly related to data engineering we've allowed interview posts like ""What are interviews like at XYZ company?"" or ""What should I prepare/study for XYZ position?""

These questions are more often than not either too difficult to meaningfully answer or have already been answered many times. Similarly to resume reviews, we will no longer be allowing these types of posts and instead point users to other resources that are better suited and focused on answering those questions like Glassdoor and Blind.

Thank you again to everyone who has been providing constructive feedback on this topic.

1asxqdx,Blog 2 - Learning SQL,"I will be focusing on SQL as the first tech stack because SQL is the core of DE and anything related to data. This blog will cover what you need to learn, the resources to learn as well as where you need to practice it.

**Step 1**: If you are completely new to SQL and want to understand the basics you can [refer](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/). Next refer [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GVFYt6_ZFM&list=PL08903FB7ACA1C2FB) to help you in understanding things like select, from, where, joins, indexes, window functions, stored procedures, functions, triggers.

**Step 2**: Next, you need to understand how the execution order of SQL is, as long as you do not understand the flow of your data in your queries you will not be able to visualize how to write queries or at least efficient ones. [This video](https://youtu.be/uEmAvzuA7u8) should help you with that.

**Step 3**: I feel that you should understand how queries are written, what should be the approach to solve a problem and for this you need to develop an intuition. I will recommend first going through the channel I mentioned in Step 2, [link](https://www.youtube.com/@ankitbansal6).

He has 4 playlists, which has really taken my query writing skills to next level. I will recommend watching them in below order:

1. [SQL Tips and Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xPxGX4mfb4&list=PLBTZqjSKn0IcR6DhoLUibOG8frnWbZdSH)
2. [SQL Medium Complex Interview Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOLBRfwzYcU&list=PLBTZqjSKn0IfuIqbMIqzS-waofsPHMS0E)
3. [Leetcode SQL Hard Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDfAo7uw-3w&list=PLBTZqjSKn0IfULLRo9Tm4lESxYMAG7fUQ)
4. [Complex SQL questions for Interview Preparation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyAgWL066Vo&list=PLBTZqjSKn0IeKBQDjLmzisazhqQy4iGkb)

I will recommend after watching the above playlists, to get your hands dirty. So far you have gained all the theoretical knowledge required now you need to start practicing it on a daily basis. The channel has the DDL and DML statements for almost all his videos in the description, if you do not have a local setup, you can use [this](https://sqliteonline.com/) and run the commands over there and start writing queries.

Now that you are through his playlists twice the questions will feel repetitive and you have gained the querying experience needed to handle problems on your own which brings us to step 4.

**Step 4**: Start Practicing.

Learning by just watching will help clear your concepts but you will need to continuously apply them to be really comfortable with it and SQL query writing practice should be done daily even if it's just 1 or 2 problems everyday. After you are done practicing the Ankit Bansal playlists you can start with below:

1. Hackerrank.
2. Go to leetcode and solve all the free questions from easy, medium and then hard level.
3. Stratascratch has good questions so you can solve the free questions over there too.

By now, you should be really good at writing complex queries. If you have followed properly then by step 3 itself you should be good at joins, windows functions, group by, cte, etc.

**Step 5**: Understand some concepts mentioned below.

You can do this step in parallel with other steps. Below are some of the concepts you need to be aware about and I will be adding pointers and updating links if and as I find them.

1. SQL Indexes, types, uses
2. [SCD Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/populate-slowly-changing-dimensions-azure-synapse-analytics-pipelines/3-choose-between-dimension-types)
3. OLAP vs OLTP
4. Normalization vs Denormalization
5. Normalization Forms
6. Data Warehouse Concepts \[[English](https://youtu.be/h0j0QN2b57M?list=PL_c9BZzLwBRK0Pc28IdvPQizD2mJlgoID), [Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiTvqSd52ak&list=PLTsNSGeIpGnGP8A74Ie1PgqHhewsqD3fv)\]

1asq126,Data Modeling: What logic to put in DBT vs in BI Layer?,"These are some questions that I have been thinking about for some time now. This all centers around what to do in the data warehouse vs what to do in the BI Layer. For the BI layer, I am sure this applies to all BI tools but I am primarily referring to PBI.   
**I am giving very simple examples here but in reality, the data has many granularities, more metrics, and more reports need to be built.**

&#x200B;

1. Do you create YRAGO, 2YRAGO metrics in DBT?
   1. Let's say you have a table of Date, Item, and Sale Amount (*Appendix Table A*). Would it make sense to create another column for YRAGO sale amount for that item on that date? I typically do not like to do that and have it done in the PBI layer. What are your thoughts?
2. Do you create aggregate tables for each major granularity?
   1. Lets say you have a table of Date, Store, Item, and Sale Amount (*Appendix Table B*). You need to create 3 reports for Sales by Item, Store, and Date. Would you make views/tables that aggregate to each granularity?

**Things I like to optimize for:**

\- Keeping the BI layer as light as possible, reusability in the DW, not keeping logic in the BI layer.

&#x200B;

Appendix:

Table A:

|Date|Item ID|Sale Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1/1/2023|a|100|

1at76os,Airbyte and similar EL tools,"I recently shared my thoughts in a previous discussion where there was some dissatisfaction mentioned regarding Airbyte. Although I haven't personally used Airbyte, on paper, it seems ideal.

It offers a unified method for establishing your EL (Extract and Load) pipeline, recognizing that the majority of these pipelinesâconnecting to standard data sources like databases, object storage, APIs, etc.âfollow a similar pattern with either scheduled batch or streaming workflows.

Airbyte appears to excel in this area, and the documentation suggests that setting up a completely new connector is relatively straightforward.

I'm eager to learn about others' experiences with Airbyte.

Additionally, I'm exploring other tools in the market. I'm in search of a solution that can seamlessly integrate data into my lakehouse, with the following criteria:

- Open-source and capable of being hosted independently (I donât want to pay for it)
- The ability to configure EL connections between sources and destinations as code, preferably in a declarative manner using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or Pulumi
- The pipeline should automatically log crucial metadata, including extraction timestamps and file sizes etc.

Historically, I've set up these extraction processes manually using self-hosted servers or lambda functions. However, the complexity tends to increase with the number of connections. Hence, I'm drawn to the concept of EL tools that offer a standardized approach to configuring these connections.",6,13,caksters,2024-02-17 17:26:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1at76os/airbyte_and_similar_el_tools/,0,False,False,False,False

I am working as a consultant for an international company as part of the solution architecture team and we are struggling to find ways to improve our orchestration setup. We are working in a Microsoft landscape with 30+ external data sources ingested through Azure Data Factory pipelines that load data into a data lake and then into Azure Synapse. Each source can be expected to have a unique extraction method (custom APIs, relational databases, sftp, SAP etc). We then need to run approximately 100 procedures to create our dimensions and another 20 to create fact tables. Currently each dimension has an identity column that is passed into the facts. Everything is then loaded into a PowerBI model that has reached 50Gb of size. Currently all steps run in sequence which can take up to 7 hours. We want to move to a more granular and flexible orchestration or implement practices that makes data processing more agile (stable surrogate keys, schedule jobs individually). Our largest bottleneck is the refresh limitations of PowerBI. 

I would really appreciate some input on our architecture and suggestions/ideas/brainstorming how we could improve.

1atccw5,Question on data pipeline and Kafka events,"Hello ,

We are having a customer application, which moves data from multiple source systems to target database. It collects real time customer transactions(\~15K transactions/sec) and send/stream those in files to a target database(which is an OLTP database i.e. postgres). And its using kafka for streaming those input files to the target database. The OLTP database will be used for real time reporting and some batch reporting usecase of customer transactions.  

Now the issue we are facing is ,

The database holds normalized table structure. And when we say , one complete transaction means it insert to multiple tables say one record in table1, two related records into table2 and one record into table3. And when the kafka events streams the data from the files, the records are not coming in proper order, means the correct scenario will be that , the transactions should first persists in TABLE1 and TABLE2 and then TABLE3, we are seeing some times the transaction has been present/reached/committed in the TABLE2 but not yet populated in TABLE1 and reports showing wrong value.

Sometimes when we try to backtrack those missing transactions , team says that events can go missing due to various reasons and its expected behavior, so you will have to replay the transactions. Sometimes it results into duplicate transactions etc.

In an ideal scenario , either the transaction should be persisted in full or not at all in the database as its atomic and should obey the ACID property as these are banking/financial transactions, but because of the event based model it seems we are not able to get it correct in the OLTP data store. And to achieve the performance/speed reference keys constraints has not been maintained in the target tables.

So my question is , how we normally design such systems. I understand Kafka is heavily used for such data streaming, so is there something which will ensure the transaction either persists in full or not at all in the target databases and will not have the missing events scenarios considering this will be a highly active system processing \~15K transaction per second during peak time? And how to ensure the completeness of a transaction in such scenario.

1at7mp7,Need help with a database project,"Hi everyone,

I have a bit of a conundrum:

I'm a data scientist and I've got the opportunity to turn a monster of an Excel workbook that's crucial for operations and KPI tracking into a database - or at least into a more efficient solution. There's a ton of business processes intertwined with this workbook and no one actually knows how many processes rely on it - or to what level detail. I'm interested in doing this as I think this is what the business needs, because I want to learn more data engineering tools and I want to learn more about that aspect of our operations.

My manager is not too technical so I have to deliver judgement calls on the more technical aspects but I have his support to delve into the topic for a couple of months and map out what I can and what I cannot do, and whether it's feasible for our small team to develop a full solution.

If the result is a ""no"" then that would be acceptable for him, too (obviously I'd work out the next steps and use the lessons learned to ""outsource"" and continue the project).

So far, so good. I talked with the colleague who developed the excel workbook over the past 5-10 years and he was of the very strong opinion of not developing a database solution ourselves but to get a professional solution for three reasons:

* we'd be 'stuck' with maintenance down the road and we're actually too small a team for that
* he thinks that we should look at the much, much bigger picture (i.e. involving more sites and departments and looking at the business processes way more holistically), and consequently buy the ""infrastructure"" to drive home the point of how crucial this technology is. Also it would make access to data silos potentially easier.
* he also fears that higher management (who's aware that this is a crucial bit of infrastructure) will then be happy with whatever ""small"" solution we come up with, and then won't be willing to pay for the ""big"" solution that would actually be necessary. The latter solution would take a couple of years to get done.

My manager is playing with the idea that we can entertain two scenarios, a short-to- midterm solution that we maybe develop ourselves and a mid-to-longterm scenario with a ""professional"" (maybe internal/central or maybe external) solution. So, I asked for another colleague and I to get a couple of months time to map the data flows and built a pilot/prototype data solution because I believe that an approach in small, reversible steps might be very valuable here - and no one has considered that yet over the last couple of years. (A couple of months because I want some time to ideate and I can't focus on this topic full-time).

The benefit of delivering a ""small"" solution would be that we'd be making a name for ourselves across the entire hierarchy. Disadvantage will be that accessing existing silos will be a slog and likely not easily available, so we'd still need some manual/workaround type of data handover to our new, independent system (at least initially).

Lastly, I talked with a senior data scientist from the central data team and he said that we should really move away from those ""small"" solutions and look at the bigger picture because they think that we should by default look at the bigger picture to move the company ahead more sustainably. After talking a bit he have me the advice of at least interviewing most of the stakeholders before even starting any coding.

So, I'm a bit confused. I just want to go ahead, get my hands dirty and get started doing things, rather than having these endless discussions. But I also see the benefits of looking at the bigger picture and I don't want to outright dismiss my (very experienced) colleagues' take on the matter.

Do you have some advice for me? Have you been in a comparable situation - and if so, how did/would you approach it?

TL;DR:

I have the opportunity to develop an in-house database solution but I'm not sure if I'm thinking too small.

Many thanks!",0,4,norfkens2,2024-02-17 17:45:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1at7mp7/need_help_with_a_database_project/,0,False,False,False,False
1aszyi3,Resource for learning AWS Kinesis,"I want to learn AWS Kinesis for data engineering perspective and there aren't much resources there on the internet. 

Most of the udemy courses only cover theoretical aspects of it. I came across this course  [Ultimate Guide to Data Streaming with AWS Kinesis | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-guide-to-data-streaming-with-aws-kinesis/) but I dont know if this is a good one.

My main goal is to learn how to do ETL with streaming data using Kinesis and other tools. ",1,3,mediocrX,2024-02-17 11:34:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1aszyi3/resource_for_learning_aws_kinesis/,1,False,False,False,False
1asmjjc,Azure Container Instance IP CICD best practices,"Hey everyone,

I am looking for some guidance for my containerized Flask app API that I am hosting in Azure. Previously I have hosted internal APIs with Azure Functions and ACR/ACI but never an external API and had some questions. 

I am using bash in my console as a makeshift CICD pipeline until I get the infrastructure squared out. So far, once I commit, the script pushes to Docker Hub and Azure Container Registry (ACR) while tagging the image with the git commit ID. It then deletes the existing container group in Azure Container Instance (ACI) and recreates it using the same FQDN.

I want to introduce Azure API Management (APIM) and Front Door (AFD) now that this will be an external facing IP. The idea here is that I can manage authentication/security/rate limits as well as use a custom DNS and point to a prod/test/dev API.

My issue is that I don't see a way to maintain a static IP on the ACI and of course if I delete and recreate it the IP will change. Then I will have to reconfigure in the APIM every time. Am I going about this wrong? It doesn't seem I can point to the FQDN in this case unfortunately. Ideally, I can rebuild the ACI without losing the IP. If not, I suppose the best practice would be to query the IP and update the corresponding setting in APIM. This won't be too difficult, but it felt like there may be a simpler way.

I am also open to advice on splitting the prod/test/dev in this case. My initial thought was to split at the resource group level so each environment would have their own instance of each service i.e. ACR/ACI/APIM/AFD. This is what I do for internal APIs. ChatGPT is telling me a single instance of APIM and AFD would suffice but I am taking it with a grain of salt.

I understand this may be more of a platform engineering question, but I am in one of those DE positions where I build the data services including the infrastructure and DevOps.

1atcpyw,Is TCP/IP Ideal in a Perfect World?,"Iâm reading about TCP/IP and I think the design of everything is amazing. It all works in a way that supports small scale, large scale, and everything between. Itâs extensibleâ¦ 

Though, I doubt it began this way. Iâm sure that the suite of protocols and methodologies were forged slowly over time as problems with scale presented itself in networking of hosts and applications.

Part of me wonders, how much of the suite is notably not optimal and would be done differently if we could just do it all over today?


Taken from Wikipedia, a brief background on TCP/IP:

> The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking.[1][2] An implementation of the layers for a particular application forms a protocol stack. From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer, handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.

>The technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.

So the IETF is focused on supporting countless variations of network types. Infinite combinations. Many of which existing due to legacy technologies.

What if we could do it all over again? Would we start with the current suite, or would there be better options for us in that scenario?",0,2,DuckDatum,2024-02-17 21:23:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1atcpyw/is_tcpip_ideal_in_a_perfect_world/,0,False,False,False,False
